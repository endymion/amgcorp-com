<p>This page is a static HTML file in /public/index.html in the amgcorp-com project.</p>

<p>This is an example of navigation using relative URLs, so that you don't need to run a test server in order to update the site:</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="page_2.html">Page 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="page_3.html">Page 3</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Note: the simple, relative links only work if all of the HTML pages are stored in the root folder. ("/public/" in this project.)  Once the page structure isn't flat any more, you have to use absolute link URLs ("/index.html" instead of "index.html") which means that you'll have to run a development server to make updates.  To keep things simple, keep the page structure flat.</p>

<p>This is an example of how to link to an image using a relative URL, so that you don't need to run a test server in order to update the site:
<img src="images/static.jpg">
</p>
