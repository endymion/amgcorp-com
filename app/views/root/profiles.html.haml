        Neil Moffitt is the founder and CEO of Angel Management Group, serving as the figurehead for Angel Management, creating new business and managing the company’s casino relationships at an executive level.  As leader of the company, Moffitt maintains a strong presence, lending his vast experience in the industry to sustain a progressive and dynamic role in the market.

        Moffitt began his career in the entertainment industry in the early 1990’s and became one of the most successful owners and operators in the United Kingdom bar and restaurant industry.  He was renowned for taking distressed assets deemed a total loss, and converting them to highly successful and desirable properties.  He received national awards for excellence on each property he developed.
      %p
        Having accomplished his goals in the bar industry, it was a natural progression into nightclubs.  In 1999, Moffitt created the brand concept “Godskitchen”.  He compiled a team and promoted the brand, which was based on electronic music and providing a total experience for the consumer.  Each event from its inception was sold out, drawing crowds as large as 10,000 people.  Moffitt moved the brand into Ibiza, known worldwide as a superpower in the club world.  Godskitchen partnered with Amnesia, voted Ibiza Club of the year in 2001, and hosted 7,000 people every Tuesday night in 2000 and 2001. During this time, the size and strength of the Godskitchen brand had become so important, Moffitt decided to create it’s own venue.  His intention was to build the most technologically advanced club in the world and in September of 2000, he and Godskitchen opened the multi-million dollar nightclub “Code” to a record-breaking turnout of 15,000 people.

        Moffitt had the foresight to recognize the future of electronic music and created a platform to foster not only the Godskitchen brand, but also the burgeoning fame of the DJ.  Moffitt formed Angel Music Group in 2001 and increased the scope of the company from owning and operating nightclubs to producing sold out Godskitchen arena events throughout the U.K., and eventually America.  With the overwhelming success of the arena events, and an unprecedented interest in the nightclub “Code” Moffitt made the decision to move into the festival market, where the number of consumers was not limited by the capacity of the venue. Moffitt combined his promotions and business experience and his relationships with talent, and created GlobalGathering.
      %p
        In 2001 GlobalGathering opened in Stratford upon Avon to a crowd of 25,000 people.  It quickly expanded from a one-day event to a two-day camping event, with crowds of over 85,000 people. It was honored with the title, “Best UK Festival” two years running by the DJ Magazine awards and is regarded as the worldwide industry forerunner for electronic festivals. The event houses over 150 artists, encompassing every genre of electronic music, from Tiesto to Kanye West. The festival grew to such a degree that Live Nation purchased half of Global Gathering and it’s sister product, Escape into the Park in 2006.  Angel Music Group and Live Nation created a joint venture that included the festival brand Hi-Fi and expanded the GlobalGathering brand and the festival business worldwide to include eleven festivals per year globally.  Moffitt’s foresight and commitment to developing the success of Angel Music Group also led him to broaden the scope of operations to encompass record deals with Virgin and Sony BMG.  With numerous compilation albums released, Godskitchen and GlobalGathering achieved “Gold Disc” status on several occasions with sales in excess of one million to date. UK Billboard Magazine named Moffitt “Top Five most Influential people in British music”.

        In need of a further challenge, Moffitt looked to America.  In 2004 he made Las Vegas, Nevada, the epicenter of nightlife, his home.  Godskitchen continued to be an international success, with residencies throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America.  This success led him to be sought out by the owner of an ailing club called ICE.  In 2004, Moffitt became the managing partner of ICE Las Vegas, the city’s largest freestanding nightclub at the time.  Moffitt’s unique management skills and ability to deal with difficult properties inspired a reality show, “The Club”, which followed the takeover and turnover of ICE by Moffitt and his team.  Moffitt took the club from a failing property in 2004 to one of the city’s most successful venues over the course of one year.  Because of his unique perspective on the electronic music craze in Europe and his relationships in this genre, Moffitt was able to book the top DJs in the world to perform, creating a wildly popular, unique, and lucrative venue.

        In 2005, Angel Management Group was formed to focus solely on the American market.  In 2006, Moffitt and Angel Management Group partnered with Tiesto, ranked the #1 DJ in the world, to create a series of arena shows in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Miami, all of which sold out.  Moffitt continued in 2006 and 2007 to co-produce music events for Bacardi and Pepsi, featuring Maria Carey, Gwen Stefani, Nine Inch Nails, and Mary J. Blige.
      %p
        Episodes of “The Club” were still airing on Spike TV, which unexpectedly led to the next step for Moffitt and his company.  Craig Nielsen, the CEO and President of Ameristar Casinos, saw the television show and contacted Moffitt for a meeting.  He liked the straightforward manner, strong personality, and colorful background of Moffitt.  In 2006, Nielsen signed a deal tasking Angel Management Group with the design, décor, marketing and operations of nightlife venues at Ameristar Casino Resort in St. Louis, Missouri.  The $15m nightclub, “Home”, opened New Year’s Eve 2007.
