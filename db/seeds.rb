Neil Moffitt is the founder and CEO of Angel Management Group, serving as the figurehead for Angel Management, creating new business and managing the company’s casino relationships at an executive level.  As leader of the company, Moffitt maintains a strong presence, lending his vast experience in the industry to sustain a progressive and dynamic role in the market.

Moffitt began his career in the entertainment industry in the early 1990’s and became one of the most successful owners and operators in the United Kingdom bar and restaurant industry.  He was renowned for taking distressed assets deemed a total loss, and converting them to highly successful and desirable properties.  He received national awards for excellence on each property he developed.

Having accomplished his goals in the bar industry, it was a natural progression into nightclubs.  In 1999, Moffitt created the brand concept “Godskitchen”.  He compiled a team and promoted the brand, which was based on electronic music and providing a total experience for the consumer.  Each event from its inception was sold out, drawing crowds as large as 10,000 people.  Moffitt moved the brand into Ibiza, known worldwide as a superpower in the club world.  Godskitchen partnered with Amnesia, voted Ibiza Club of the year in 2001, and hosted 7,000 people every Tuesday night in 2000 and 2001. During this time, the size and strength of the Godskitchen brand had become so important, Moffitt decided to create it’s own venue.  His intention was to build the most technologically advanced club in the world and in September of 2000, he and Godskitchen opened the multi-million dollar nightclub “Code” to a record-breaking turnout of 15,000 people.

Moffitt had the foresight to recognize the future of electronic music and created a platform to foster not only the Godskitchen brand, but also the burgeoning fame of the DJ.  Moffitt formed Angel Music Group in 2001 and increased the scope of the company from owning and operating nightclubs to producing sold out Godskitchen arena events throughout the U.K., and eventually America.  With the overwhelming success of the arena events, and an unprecedented interest in the nightclub “Code” Moffitt made the decision to move into the festival market, where the number of consumers was not limited by the capacity of the venue. Moffitt combined his promotions and business experience and his relationships with talent, and created GlobalGathering.

In 2001 GlobalGathering opened in Stratford upon Avon to a crowd of 25,000 people.  It quickly expanded from a one-day event to a two-day camping event, with crowds of over 85,000 people. It was honored with the title, “Best UK Festival” two years running by the DJ Magazine awards and is regarded as the worldwide industry forerunner for electronic festivals. The event houses over 150 artists, encompassing every genre of electronic music, from Tiesto to Kanye West. The festival grew to such a degree that Live Nation purchased half of Global Gathering and it’s sister product, Escape into the Park in 2006.  Angel Music Group and Live Nation created a joint venture that included the festival brand Hi-Fi and expanded the GlobalGathering brand and the festival business worldwide to include eleven festivals per year globally.  Moffitt’s foresight and commitment to developing the success of Angel Music Group also led him to broaden the scope of operations to encompass record deals with Virgin and Sony BMG.  With numerous compilation albums released, Godskitchen and GlobalGathering achieved “Gold Disc” status on several occasions with sales in excess of one million to date. UK Billboard Magazine named Moffitt “Top Five most Influential people in British music”.

In need of a further challenge, Moffitt looked to America.  In 2004 he made Las Vegas, Nevada, the epicenter of nightlife, his home.  Godskitchen continued to be an international success, with residencies throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America.  This success led him to be sought out by the owner of an ailing club called ICE.  In 2004, Moffitt became the managing partner of ICE Las Vegas, the city’s largest freestanding nightclub at the time.  Moffitt’s unique management skills and ability to deal with difficult properties inspired a reality show, “The Club”, which followed the takeover and turnover of ICE by Moffitt and his team.  Moffitt took the club from a failing property in 2004 to one of the city’s most successful venues over the course of one year.  Because of his unique perspective on the electronic music craze in Europe and his relationships in this genre, Moffitt was able to book the top DJs in the world to perform, creating a wildly popular, unique, and lucrative venue.

In 2005, Angel Management Group was formed to focus solely on the American market.  In 2006, Moffitt and Angel Management Group partnered with Tiesto, ranked the #1 DJ in the world, to create a series of arena shows in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Miami, all of which sold out.  Moffitt continued in 2006 and 2007 to co-produce music events for Bacardi and Pepsi, featuring Maria Carey, Gwen Stefani, Nine Inch Nails, and Mary J. Blige.

Episodes of “The Club” were still airing on Spike TV, which unexpectedly led to the next step for Moffitt and his company.  Craig Nielsen, the CEO and President of Ameristar Casinos, saw the television show and contacted Moffitt for a meeting.  He liked the straightforward manner, strong personality, and colorful background of Moffitt.  In 2006, Nielsen signed a deal tasking Angel Management Group with the design, décor, marketing and operations of nightlife venues at Ameristar Casino Resort in St. Louis, Missouri.  The $15m nightclub, “Home”, opened New Year’s Eve 2007.

Neil Moffitt is a leader in the entertainment industry with a long and varied background in all aspects of entertainment.  Moffitt and Angel Management Group are in a unique position to create entertainment concepts utilizing global relationships and experience.  AMG will continue to expand the scope of the business, providing services and solutions for clients as well as developing innovative, hip and unique concepts in all entertainment avenues.

The New York native moved to Las Vegas in 2000, after House of Blues recruited him to become the Director of Operations in the Foundation Room at Mandalay Bay. He went on to serve as general manager at ICE Las Vegas, where he made his reality TV debut as part of the Spike TV series, The Club, and met the future founder and CEO of Angel Management Group, Neil Moffitt.

  :name => 'Nick McCabe',
  :body => <<EOP
Nick McCabe’s career in entertainment and nightlife may have started in the U.K., but it was his passion and drive for success that brought him to the U.S.

His love for technology met entertainment and nightlife during the electronic music boom of the mid ’90s, when he worked as a music producer and event promoter while attending the University of Teesside. He achieved a first class degree in interactive graphic design before he moved to Miami in 1999, where he discovered and embraced the city’s burgeoning bar and nightclub scene.

McCabe’s talents impacted the city’s massive nightlife industry the following year, when he launched an innovative nightlife and lifestyle website, CoolJunkie.com. The portal quickly became the nightlife authority in Miami, and McCabe soon took it national, with satellite sites in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, among other U.S. cities.

CoolJunkie’s popularity attracted the attention of New York-based lifestyle marketing firm Track Entertainment, which purchased the online operation in 2005. McCabe became partner, CCO and acting creative director at Track after the acquisition, and oversaw an array of large-scale and high profile projects for well-known brands, including Pepsi, T-Mobile, Aquafina and Sierra Mist. Meantime, he also assisted in the development of Clubplanet.com, Wantickets.com and NocheLatina.com.

McCabe created and executed a series of intensely popular music festivals for Bacardi in 2006. Held in Miami, New York and Las Vegas, Bacardi B-Live featured A-list rock, urban, electronic and Latin music acts, and went on to become some of the most successful music marketing events in Bacardi’s history.

With the momentum of Bacardi B-Live fueling his ambition, McCabe formed his own music marketing company, The Big Idea, in 2007. Through this new business, he continued to work on Bacardi B-Live in conjunction with Angel Management Group, but it wasn’t long before he decided to join the AMG team on a full-time basis.

After joining Angel Management Group, McCabe continued to develop the Bacardi B-Live concept, and also assumed responsibility for all other creative and interactive projects for the company.

As vice president of creative and interactive at Angel Management Group, McCabe currently oversees all technology related projects, including a trio of proprietary software solutions, TicketDriver, ArtistDriver and VenueDriver. He is also in charge of the creative team, which produces marketing and branding campaigns for MGM Grand, New York-New York and Hard Rock Hotel, among other corporate clients.

  :name => 'Alex Cordova',
  :body => <<EOP
With twelve years of proprietor experience in nightclubs stretching from New York City to Las Vegas, Alex Cordova has an extensive knowledge of the nightlife industry, encompassing party planning and promotions as well as management and marketing.

Cordova was educated at Williams College, after which he embarked on an impressive promotional career with many of New York’s hottest nightclubs. Over the last twelve years, Alex has positioned himself as arguably one of the most powerful promoters and event producers in the country. In New York and Las Vegas, Alex has worked with such prestigious brands as Cheetah, Eugenes, Float, Lot 61, and Pangaea through his wholly-owned company known as CliQue Entertainment. CliQue Entertainment was established as a lifestyle marketing company that specialized in event planning and nightclub consultation. During his tenure with CliQue Entertainment he handled successful events at more than twenty of New York City's top nightclubs, as well as serving as an ongoing marketing consultant for various top venues.

In 2003, Cordova brought CliQue Entertainment to Las Vegas where he was hired by Park Place Entertainment (Caesar’s Entertainment) to handle the marketing for their failing outlet “Risque” in the Paris Hotel and Casino.  After a year under his stewardship, the venue was ranked ‘best nightclub of 2003’ by the Las Vegas Review Journal.

In 2004, Cordova was retained by MGM Grand to produce a weekly event at Las Vegas’ most prestigious Ultra Lounge, “Tabu.” In 2004, he was responsible for the revival of Mandalay Bay Group's “Moorea Beach” ultra lounge in late 2004, Mr. Cordova was hired by Pure Management Group to spearhead the marketing and promotions for Pure Nightclub. In 2006, Pure was ranked the #1 “Hippest Hotspot” in the World by E! Entertainment, and Cordova was part of a team that drove $51m in revenue during that year, with PMG as a whole grossing over $110m.  In the nightclub industry Mr. Cordova is generally recognized as the key player to Pure’s immense success over the past years.

Cordova joined Angel Management Group in 2008, and immediately set about improving programming and operations at Wet Republic at MGM Grand. He was instrumental in developing the pool’s reputation for being the place in Las Vegas for A-list celebrities, performers and athletes, and after less than a year under his leadership, the venue saw gross revenues more than double—from $5 million in 2008 to more than $13 million in 2009.

As Vice President of Marketing at Angel Management Group, Cordova is responsible for overseeing the marketing, promotions and VIP services for the entire company portfolio.
